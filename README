There is one android studio project that is both the client and translator. The main activity has a tabbed view so you can switch between client and translator.

Steps I took to create this
-Setup Android Studio project with tabbed view
-Removed the settings menu in the top right as it is not needed
-Setup basic layout for client as a fragment
-added a button listener and populated the drop down boxes
-Setup basic layout for translator as a fragment
-added button listener and retrieved all the fields that would be needed in the create function
-set up aws ec2 server with ubuntu
-drew some sketches of a basic outline for the server
-started writing the server
-wrote a basic connector on phone to make sure I can connect to server
-finished the client side of the phone app with default reponse from server
-finished the server
-set up the translator side to connect
-set up translator to take new message and post translation on submit
-tested to make sure there were no crashes and it was stable
-put up server with nohup
